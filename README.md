 Unicorn Startup Trend Analysis 

 📊 Project Overview
This is an analysis of the Maven dataset related to unicorns and start ups around the world. The brief was to explore what makes a unicorn, look at the industries, and see how they perform around the world.
For this, I looked at durations and timelines, then created several metrics to examine the best performing industries on average, then looked to highlight the key hubs or cities around the world where unicorns tended to gather.

The project combines PostgreSQL, Python-based EDA, and Power BI dashboard to simulate a real-world analytics workflow used in industry.
